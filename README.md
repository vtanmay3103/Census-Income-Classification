# Census-Income-Classification
#### Dataset used in this project is taken from [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), this is census dataset for classifying the income in two categories, which are income less than or more than 50k.
#### Implemented the classifiers - Logistic Regression, KNN, SVC, Random Forest Classifier, then selected Random Forest Classifier and KNN based on f1 and roc score for tuning and final prediction.
#### Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning of Random Forest classifier and KNN
#### Random Forest classifier achieves the test accuracy of 84% while KNN achieves approx 83% accuracy
### Random Forest Classifier is the best model with 84% accuracy
